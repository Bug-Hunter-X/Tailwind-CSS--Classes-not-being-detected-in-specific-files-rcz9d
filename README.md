# Tailwind CSS Class Detection Issue

This repository demonstrates a common problem encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not being detected in specific files. This usually stems from an incorrectly configured `content` option within your `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Problem

Tailwind directives might be present in your component files, but they remain unrecognized by Tailwind, leading to the styles not being applied.  This often occurs when the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` doesn't accurately reflect the location of your component files.

## Solution

The solution involves meticulously reviewing and adjusting the `content` option within your `tailwind.config.js` file to ensure it correctly points to all directories and files containing your components that use Tailwind directives. Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for a corrected configuration example.  Ensure that the glob patterns cover all the necessary file types (.js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx, .html etc.) and paths.
